# Lua-Random-Projects

A bunch of Lua random projects built with Codea for amusement.

List:

1. The Game Of Life: 

John Conway's famous Game of Life. To try it out simply copy and paste each "class" file. You can also try two patterns I added by going to the Grid class and uncomment either the gosper glider gun or the acorn and commenting the init function.

2. 2058

A very simple (no fancy game UI) implementation of the game 2048. To try it out simply copy and paste each "class" file.
